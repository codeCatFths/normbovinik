            <h3>Where is Norm?</h3>
			
			<p>
            Norm is from northern California and misses the brisk beaches and cool weather. Norm spends most of his work time inside coding and doing research but loves to trek on local beaches to unwind and get in touch with the elements.  Norm travels for work, mostly on the west coast between southern California and Alaska - spending time in cities like Seattle and Vancouver, BC.  He has a love of science fiction so space memorabilia is one of his favorites. Getting a chance to visit the Museum of Flight in Seattle to see the exhibition about the Apollo 11 mission was a highlight of his summer travels for work.  Norm is an avid cook, cultivating a kitchen garden in addition to an outside patio space at home where he can relax with the hummingbirds and butterflies while the cats sun themselves.  He likes cool weather so his travels up and down the coast let him indulge in bundling up and trekking.  For the most part, if he is not traveling for work, Norm is a home body.
