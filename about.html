            <h3>Who is Norm?</h3>

			<h3>This is Norm</h3>
            
            <p>
            Norm B. Ovinik is a twenty-something young man of a delicate build with a casual style and impish personality. He is a coder, an artist and a developing chef. With a cloud of chin length dark hair with white streaks tucked behind his ears, his green-eyed gaze is often cat-like. He cultivates a sleepy expression. He has almond-shaped eyes, slanted eyebrows and sports a series of whisker-like scars along his left cheek. Norm is a creature of comfort, enjoying worn-in jeans and boots, often tossing on an aged leather jacket and luxuriating in soft knit scarves. He smells of sage or salvia. Quiet, somewhat awkward and reserved, on a lark and as a throw-back to his mixed Polish and Japanese heritage, Norm attended the Polish-Japanese Institute of Technology where he studied New Media Arts. He works as a consultant for government agencies.

            When looking for cool names for the character,  the creator was searching out "cat gods" and "cat demons". So the Japanese "ancestry" influence came from <blockquote>"The bakeneko (化け猫, "changed cat") is a type of Japanese yōkai, or supernatural creature. According to its name, it is a cat  that has changed into a yōkai."
                <p style="font-size:8pt"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakeneko" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p></blockquote>

            The origin of Norm's last name "Ovinik" came from another Google search for inspiration. <blockquote>"Ovinnik in Slavic mythology was the spirit of the barn—from ovin (barn)— who looked like a large black cat with fiery eyes but had a fierce bark like a dog."

            His coding interests comes from his creator as does the graphic arts interest. The Polish-Japanese Institute of Technology popped while the creator was following Google rabbit holes researching for this character.  When reading about their programs, the creator thought it was perfect for this character.
